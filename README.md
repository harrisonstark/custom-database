# custom-database
## Running the Code
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the python file, for example: "python3 database.py"
3. Use the CLI as input to the program, running functions like "put User_A 12"
## Future Modifications
I think this assignment is a good start, but it should be modified to have a sample file given that must be processed. The output could be piped to a file, and the student could create a diff between their program's output and the expected output. This would ensure that the graders could run their file, generate the output, and score them based on the diff.
